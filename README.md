# TrendFusion-Analytics

Trend Fusion Analytics is a web app designed to give clothing merchants insights into market
trends. It helps tackle the challenge of understanding market dynamics using data scraped from
eCommerce sites. The app offers features like a product performance dashboard, price
optimization, and trend analysis by brand and category.
We use Streamlit, a pytho library for the app along with BeautifulSoup and Requests
handling data scraping. This ensures a user-friendly experience for exploring market data.

Trend Fusion Analytics empowers businesses with insights for better decision-making in the
competitive apparel market.

It not only helps the merchants but also allows the buyers to check the trends and buy the best products.
